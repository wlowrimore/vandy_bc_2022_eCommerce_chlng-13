# (ORM) e-Commerce Back End

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-purple)<br />

## Description
This is the back-end that could be used for an e-commerce platform (website). I've taken a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The functionality of this project gives the user the ability to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) products. Because of the use of relational tables within the database, the products' categories and tags can also be manipulated by implementing the CRUD method.
